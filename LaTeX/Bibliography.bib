OPTabstract={Cisplatin conjugated onto macromolecules or loaded in micelles can be preferentially delivered to tumors to minimize its toxicity to healthy tissues and increase its drug efficacy. Herein, we report cisplatin-containing nanogels possibly useful for targeted delivery of cisplatin. Carboxylic acid-functionalized poly($\beta$ -aminoester)graft-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers were synthesized by cocondensation polymerization of piperazine with 2,2-bis(acryloxymethyl)propionic acid, PEG 2,2-bis(acryloxymethyl)propionate macromonomer (mPEG). The graft copolymers formed 100-200 nm nanogels with low size-distribution by the complexation of their carboxylic groups with cisplatin. The nanogels were negatively charged and had a PEG outer layer. Thus, they had “stealth properties” suitable for in vivo applications. The nanogels had significantly lower in vitro cytotoxicity to SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells than free cisplatin, but similar anticancer activity toward SKOV-3 tumors xenografted to immunocompromised mice.}

abstract={The new concept developed in this study is the preparation of a new derivative of erythrocyte ghosts, i.e., membrane vesicles loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) HCl and coupled to folic acid to improve cancer chemotherapy. N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) folate was then conjugated to membrane vesicles. These membrane vesicles were extensively characterized for in vitro and in vivo performance. The vesicle size obtained was in the range of 1.2-1.5 $\mu$m and in vitro release profile showed 51.8 and 38.7\% of drug release in case of Dox-V and Dox-FV, respectively, in 16 hr. The stability studies were performed at 4°C by assessing the effect on vesicle size and leakage after 7, 15, and 21 days. The stability study showed negligible leakage and no appreciable change in the vesicle size after storage for several days in both formulations. The cytostatic activity was assessed and found that IC50 was decreased 3.2 and 2.1 times for Dox-FV compared with free drug and Dox-V, respectively. The cytotoxic activity showed similar profile among the formulations: order of toxicity was Dox-FV > Dox-V > free drug. The mean survival time was found in order of Dox-FV > Dox-V > free drug > control (FV). The increase in life for Dox-FV was 212.9\%. Overall, this folic acid conjugated vesicle system proved to be a potential delivery system for improved cancer therapy.}

abstract={Various drug delivery and targeting systems and approaches are currently utilized for cancer chemotherapy. Many drugs being developed through biotechnology are also in various stages of clinical trials. The most common approaches with drug delivery and targeting systems have been those using stealth liposomes or microspheres. Recent efforts have been made to use stealth nanoparticles for cancer drug delivery. In the next few years, it is expected that several liposomal products will be on the market. Another approach that has been utilized for some time has been the use of antibody-directed drugs or toxins. Several immunotoxins are currently in phase III trials, and efforts are being made to potentiate their activity with different potentiators. In an effort to understand the intricacies of tumor morphology and the limitations of drug targeting, various mathematical models have been proposed that help in designing appropriate delivery systems for successful tumor targeting. This review considers a number of drug targeting systems, especially microparticulate and colloidal systems, for cancer therapy.}

volume= {7},

pages={15-19},
}
abstract={Cationic liposomes are commonly used for transfection of plasmids into mammalian cells, while microspheres have been traditionally used for selective delivery of anticancer agents into tumor vasculature. We have developed a novel vector, comprised of cationic liposomes electrostatically bound to ion-exchange microspheres (termed 'microplex') for targeted gene therapy of solid tumors. The delivery modes tested in a rat solid tumor model were free plasmids, plasmids bound to microspheres, to liposomes, or to the combination vector. The greatest amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expression in tumors was achieved using the microplex vector; 3.4-fold compared with free, and 1.8-fold compared with both microspherical and liposomal deliveries (p < 0.01). Tumor-to-normal kidney tissue CAT expression ratios were as follows: free 1.9:1; microspherical 3.7:1; liposomal 1.4:1 and microplexical 2.7:1. Expression between the two types of tissues was significantly different (p < 0.01) for all delivery modes. Microspheres targeted the plasmids to the tumors, while the action of cationic liposomes on cellular membranes allowed more plasmids to breach the cell membrane. This study has proven that the novel microplex vector is capable of selective delivery of genes to tumors and has the potential to target genes in clinical trials.}

journal={ Drug Delivery},
volume={ 15}, 
issue={5},
pages={ 343-346},
}
abstract={To improve delivery efficiency of anastrozole, we applied dendrimer-based stealth nanoparticles to encapsulate anastrozole to formulate stealth anastrozole nanoparticles. This work demonstrated that stealth nanoparticles composed of a PAMAM dendrimers core and a PEG layer could encapsulate anastrozole, hence causing improved water solubility of anastrozole. Anastrozole encapsulation depended on concentration of stealth nanoparticles and generation of dendrimer. The extended release of anastrozole was achieved. We envisioned that this highly structurally adaptable stealth nanoparticle could be further biofunctionalized to construct a targeted therapeutic delivery system for breast cancer treatment.}

abstract={Efficacy of $\alpha$-TEA formulated in liposome or biodegradable poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticle was evaluated in a BALB/c clone 66cl-4 mammary cancer mouse model using oral delivery. α-TEA-loaded liposome or nanoparticle at 5 mg, but not 2.5 mg/day, significantly reduced tumor burden (p < 0.001). Both formulations at 5 mg significantly reduced visible lung metastases and lymph node and lung micrometastatic tumor foci. Surprisingly, nanoparticle control mice exhibited significantly reduced tumor burden, lymph node, and lung micrometastatic tumor foci. Both formulations at 5 mg significantly enhanced tumor apoptosis. In summary, liposomes and nanoparticles are effective means for administering the lipophilic anticancer drug $\alpha$ -TEA.}

abstract = "Electroporation is generally used to transfect cells in suspension, but the technique can also be applied to load a defined zone of adherent cells with substances that normally do not permeate the plasma membrane. In this case a pulsed high-frequency oscillating electric field is applied over a small two-wire electrode positioned close to the cells. We compared unipolar with bipolar electroporation pulse protocols and found that the latter were ideally suited to efficiently load a narrow longitudinal strip of cells in monolayer cultures. We further explored this property to determine whether electroporation loading was useful to investigate the extent of dye spread between cells coupled by gap junctions, using wild-type and stably transfected C6 glioma cells expressing connexin 32 or 43. Our investigations show that the spatial spread of electroporation-loaded 6-carboxyfluorescein, as quantified by the standard deviation of Gaussian dye spread or the spatial constant of exponential dye spread, was a reliable approach to investigate the degree of cell-cell coupling. The spread of reporter dye between coupled cells was significantly larger with electroporation loading than with scrape loading, a widely used method for dye-coupling studies. We conclude that electroporation loading and dye transfer is a robust technique to investigate gap-junctional coupling that combines minimal cell damage with accurate probing of the degree of cell-cell communication."

  abstract={We introduce a novel approach for imaging solutions of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles using magneto-motive optical Doppler tomography (MM-ODT). MM-ODT combines an externally applied temporally oscillating high-strength magnetic field with ODT to detect nanoparticles flowing through a microfluidic channel. A solenoid with a cone-shaped ferrite core extensively increased the magnetic field strength (Bmax = 1 T, \\nabla \\vert B\\vert\^{}{2}=220\~{}\\mathrm {T\^{}{2}\~{}m\^{}{-1}} ) at the tip of the core and also focused the magnetic field in microfluidic channels containing nanoparticle solutions. Nanoparticle contrast was demonstrated in a microfluidic channel filled with an SPIO solution by imaging the Doppler frequency shift which was observed independently of the nanoparticle flow rate and direction. Results suggest that MM-ODT may be applied to image Doppler shift of SPIO nanoparticles in microfluidic flows with high contrast.}

Polymersomes are polymer-based vesicular shells that form upon hydration of amphiphilic block copolymers. These high molecular weight amphiphiles impart physicochemical properties that allow polymersomes to stably encapsulate or integrate a broad range of active molecules. This robustness together with recently described mechanisms for controlled breakdown of degradable polymersomes as well as escape from endolysosomes suggests that polymersomes might be usefully viewed as having structure/property/function relationships somewhere between lipid vesicles and viral capsids. Here we summarize the assembly and development of controlled release polymersomes to encapsulate therapeutics ranging from small molecule anti-cancer drugs to siRNA and therapeutic proteins."

In the theory proposed here, the hypernetted-chain integral equations are solved on a three-dimensional cubic grid to calculate the spatial distribution of the potential entropically induced between a very big body of arbitrary geometry and a big sphere immersed in small spheres. Effects due to the geometric feature of the very big body (e.g., step edges, trenches, corners, and changing curvature) can then be investigated by analyzing the potential along a specific trajectory of the big sphere. Several model calculations are performed, and the results obtained are interpreted in terms of the roles of the entropic excluded-volume effects in highly ordered processes occurring within colloidal and biological systems (e.g., the lock and key steric interaction between macromolecules). Discussion is also given to related subjects such as the formation of secondary structures of a protein molecule in aqueous solution, the construction of controlled particle arrays, and the synthesis of a molecular tube using the complex formation by cyclic molecules and linear polymers."
